# Planet Conjunctions

This repository contains Python scripts to compute planetary conjunctions. They use the Python based 
[Skyfield](https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield) package from [Brandon Rhodes](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes)
for calculations. 

In the context of the conjunctions.py script, a conjunction is used to refer to a
grouping of planets within an angular span of interest with respect to thier ecliptic longitude.
